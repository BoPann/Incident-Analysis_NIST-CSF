# Introduction
NIST CSF stands for National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. 
It's a voluntary framework developed by NIST to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk.
In this project, I utilized the framework to create an incident respond to a simulated cyber event. 

### Five Core Functions
**Identify**: Identify critical assets, data, and systems.
**Protect**: Implement measures to prevent or deter cyber threats.
**Detect**: Monitor for and detect cybersecurity incidents.
**Respond**: Respond to detected incidents.
**Recover**: Restore systems and data after an incident.
